<h2>Descriptions of certain DB file formats</h2>
All HP-LX database files are based on the general GDB file format,
the file extension is usually GDB.  There is a very useful description
available from Thadeus[1].  Below you find a few remarks about
special DB file formats which are all variants of the GDB file
format.

    Appointment Book format; this is the most complex variation since
    there are two different item types (appointments and to-dos) and
    a lot more nasty elements that make things difficult, e.g. repeated
    items and so on.

    Notetaker; only one header byte is different from GDB [T2D: verify]
<tr><td><a href="pdb-format.html">pdb-format.html</a><td>
    Phonebook; The only thing special about PDB files is that they
    are used by the phonebook application which creates new databases
    with predefined fields and layouts.  Fields and layout can be edited
    by the normal database application and the phonebook application is
    able to work with any GDB or modefied PDB file. (At least as far
    as I know...)

    The World Time Database uses application specific special types,
    there's nothing fancy about it, really.
