This release contains again a couple of improvements and bug fixes and
a bit better error and constraint handling.

1. General DB handling, module DB.pm:
   a. implements the password and data decryption routines from
      Curtis Cameron's dbcheck.pas program.





Acknowledgements:
1. Curtis Cameron shared valuable results from his dbcheck program.
   His password decoder and insight into the structure of ADB files
   are very much appreciated.

I hope the software is useful for your purposes, but use it at your own
risk!  Feedback, e.g. bug reports, fixes and other suggestions are
welcome.
