Purpose:

  DBgui.pm implements the Perl package HP200LX::DBgui which is
  can be used together with HP200LX::DB to create Perl/Tk
  user interfaces for HP 200LX database files.

Status:

  The package and any other files are in a completely EXPERIMENTAL
  STATUS and should not be used without proper backup.  Use it at your
  own risk, no support can be provided but bug reports and suggestions
  by e-mail are welcome.  Please read the notes below first.

  Note: The package emits all sorts of diagnostic information, these
        are not errors and change from release to release, depending
        on the development progress.

Installation:

  The usual installation strategy

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    # make test  (there are no tests currently)
    make install

  should produce viable modules.

Limitations:

  Development has been driven by my own requirements and my needs
  are not so big, so you should not be surprised if much remains left
  to be done.  Here is a list of missing things that I'm aware of:

Examples:

  The scripts directory contains this only one example, as of now:
    xdb.pl              Perl/Tk GUI for DB files
